**Notes App**
The Notes App is a simple Java-based console application that allows users to create and manage text-based notes.

Features:
âž• Add Notes â€“ Write and save notes into a text file.
ðŸ“– View Notes â€“ Read and display all saved notes from the file.
ðŸ’¾ Persistent Storage â€“ Notes remain stored in notes.txt even after program exit.
âš¡ Simple CLI Interface â€“ Easy-to-use menu-driven console app.
